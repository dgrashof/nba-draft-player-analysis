# NBA Draft Player Analysis

# Introduction
---
This project is designed to take a deeper dive into the NBA draft, the ultimate prediction. Every year, teams build their list of the players in the draft they believe will have the most NBA success. Despite far-reaching advancements (and investments) across NBA front offices in data science  and scouting, it's still a crap shoot. Teams consistently spend high draft picks to draft players that never see the floor and live up to their projections. This happens for many different reasons; some are predictable and others are not. 

In the 2012 NBA Draft, the Sacramento Kings had the 5th pick. With their selection, they took Thomas Robinson, a third-year, 6-9 forward/center out of Kansas. Robinson was appealing because he had athleticism that many believed would translate to the NBA right away. But a quick glance at his statistics showed a few red flags. For starters, almost every NBA player needs to excel at one of these things: Rim protection, Perimeter Defense, Shot Creation or Playmaking. In his three years at Kansas, Robinson did not show any of these skills proficiently. Rim protection - he had only a 1.1 blocks per 40 minutes. Roy Hibbert, the standard bearer of modern rim protection had 3.4 blocks per 40. Anthony Davis, one of the best modern big men in the NBA had 5.8 blocks per game. Clearly, Robinson was not going to bring this skill to the NBA despite his 6-9 height and 7-1 wingspan. At 6-9 and 237 lbs, Robinson had no chance of excelling at perimeter defense. His size would not allow him to keep up with the quickest wings in the league and 1.4 steals per 40 solidifed that. Shot Creation - Robinson took only 14 three pointers in his last year at Kansas, albeit making 7 of them. Perhaps he wasn't given the green light by his coach? This is possible, but his 68% free throw percentage, a good indicator of NBA shooting ability, says otherwise.
